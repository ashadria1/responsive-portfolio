Title:

Responsive Portfolio Project


Description:
This project explores some basic Bootstrap components like Navbar, Contact Me, and a portfolio of photos, all linked to one another, and incorporating CSS grid concepts and responsive layouts.

This is a great exercise for putting together a basic set of profile pages that are self-contained, and linked to one another.  Most code can be found on the W3 Schools or Getbootstrap websites, and tweaked to your liking.

I'm still trying to get the CSS right, and I could play around with it all day, finding new and interesting configurations.  If only I had the time...

In the future, I would like to add more responsiveness, a prettier Navbar, etc.  I'd like to gain more proficiency in changing and manipulating all the different style elements.

My project is deployed, and a link to the deployed application can be found here:

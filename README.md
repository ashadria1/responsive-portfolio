# Responsive Portfolio Project


## Description 

Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile‚Äîand one that many new developers often overlook‚Äîis the README.md file.

The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? 

Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

# Unit 02: CSS and Bootstrap

## Overview
When web developers find themselves repeating a task, they often look for programmatic solutions. A prime example is setting up boilerplate HTML and CSS that can be reused. In the previous unit, you built and deployed a simple portfolio site. Now imagine that you're building portfolios for several clients. An efficient approach to this scenario would be to create a main stylesheet and then customize copies of it for each portfolio. In doing so, you'd be implementing a simple CSS framework. 

CSS frameworks allow us to quickly style a web application so we can focus on **bootstrapping** it (i.e., building and deploying the business logic). Most CSS frameworks handle the more challenging aspects of CSS for us, such as floats and media queries. Another benefit of using CSS frameworks is that it ensures consistency across applications. Depending on your career trajectory, you may find yourself maintaining multiple web applications and, as you learned in the previous unit, CSS can get unruly very quickly. As applications scale, being able to easily maintain and organize your codebase becomes very important.

The CSS framework we'll use in this course is Bootstrap. Bootstrap was one of the first CSS frameworks and is, at the time of this writing, the most widely used in production. It was created by the developers at Twitter for the reasons discussed above and released as an open source project in 2011, meaning anyone could use it in their applications for free. There are dozens of CSS frameworks to choose from now. Learning Bootstrap will set you up to quickly adapt to almost any framework as they tend to share the same underlying concept of a grid system structured by rows and columns.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* Developer tools
* CSS resets
* Typography
* Pseudo-classes
* !important
* Media queries
* Viewport tag
* CDN
* Bootstrap
* Bootstrap components
  * Bootstrap predefined classes
  * Bootstrap rows, columns, and containers
  * Bootstrap grids
* GitHub Pages

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. What is a CDN?
2. What is a CSS framework?
3. What are three benefits of using a CSS framework?

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

* Explain the importance of CSS resets and cross-browser compatibility
* Explain and implement content delivery network links in HTML files
* Implement a grid layout in HTML to leverage the benefits of a CSS framework
* Integrate Bootstrap components in HTML files to quickly build user interfaces
* Add custom styling to a CSS framework
* Deploy to GitHub pages

## Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate your portfolio.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.


## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.


## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
